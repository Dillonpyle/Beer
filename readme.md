## User Stories:

The user lands on an index page that has a log in form. They can enter their information (if they have a log in) and click log in. If they do not, they can click register and be taken to a registration page asking for the information necessary to fill out their model. When they finish, they will be taken back to the index page.

The index page contains links to beers, breweries, and "my fridge."

If the user clicks on "beers" they will be taken to a list of all the types of beers that people have registered in their fridges. If they click the beer, it will take them to a page that gives information about that beer (type, price, etc) and a list of who has it, and who makes it. From their they can click on the brewery or the users who have the beer.

When a user lands on another user's page, it will show the beers in their fridge, and some stats about their usage and previous beers and ratings.

The brewery pages will contain information about the brewery, and their beers that have been entered, and links to all of the beers that they make.

On a user's own page ("my fridge"), they will have an "enter beers into your fridge" option. This will give them a form to enter information about the beer, and how many of that beer they have in their fridge.
Their page will also allow them to delete beers when they drink them.

The header of all pages will contain links to the main index, and a logout option.

Users can only enter new information or edit information if they have logged in. Otherwise the menus won't show.
