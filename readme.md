## User Stories:

The home page welcomes the User to BeerFridge, a new social site for beer loves to show the world what they keep in stock.

New users can register, and existing users can login, from the the links at the top of the page.

Registering and editing the account allows users to pick a username, password, home city and state, and load a profile picture if they want.

Once registered or logged in, a world of possibilities awaits. Users can add new breweries and beers if their favorites are not yet on the site. They can put beers in their fridge to match what they have at home. Once they drink the beer, it gets removed from their fridge, just like in real life.

When adding a beer, the user puts its name, style, price point, color, and a short flavor description. They can even upload a photo of their beer at home. The user who creates the beer can edit it at any time.

Breweries are added and beers can be assigned to the brewery that makes them. The brewery page lets users know where the brewery is located, and what beers they make.

The index pages for beers, breweries, and users allow visitors to click links and visit the pages of the individual items.

When a registered user visits a beer page, they can give it an "upvote" to let people know that the beer is delicious!

User pages contain fridges that visitors can take a look inside to see what the user has on hand.

Users can only enter new information or edit information if they have logged in.

We know you will enjoy sharing the contents of your BeerFridge!
